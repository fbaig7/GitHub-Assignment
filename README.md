# GitHub-Assignment
This project demonstrates sorting arrays of both integers and strings in Java. It showcases Git version control processes by creating branches for each sorting feature, making commits, and pushing changes to a GitHub repository. The main class runs sorting algorithms on sample arrays, providing a practical exercise for Git usage alongside basic Java programming.
